# p3ppc.visibleRankupReady
Adds indicators that Social Links are ready to rank up in the Social Link menu and when talking to them. (Also on [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/mods/457935)!)

More specifically: 

When talking to an S.Link if they will rank up when you spend time with them you will get the message "You feel your relationship is going to become closer soon".

In the S.Link menu any S.Links that will rank up the next time you spend time with them will have an arrow next to their rank (excluding links that automatically rank up through story events).
